Every prospect predicted in here was determined using leave-one-out testing.

For example, Kyrie Irving's score was determined by creating a model with all the same PG/SG data (including other 2011 prospects) except for Kyrie's.

I decided to split the results by draft year then positions (guards, wings, and bigs) to interpret the results easier as I can compare prospects relative to their draft class.
